# RealEstateCompanies

This program is a portfolio project for one of my college classes. The idea is to create a Real Estate Inquiry Information System. 

For each real estate information system inquiry, this program outputs the following detailed information:  real estate company number, real estate company name, real estate listing agent number, real estate agent name, real estate listing agent phone number, property multi list number, property parcel number, property parcel identification, property type (C for Commercial or R for Residential), property address, city, state, zip code, asking price of the property, assessed value of the building, assessed value of the land, total assessed value of the property (building + land), as well as the local, municipal, real estate taxes, as well as the total taxes for the property.  

The classes representing the real estate/property include inheritance, constructor(s), accessor and mutator methods, as well as the methods to handle all of the tax calculations.
